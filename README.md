This app is a full-stack web application that utilizes various technologies to create a robust and maintainable user experience.

On the *frontend*, the app is built using the `Nuxt 3` framework, which allows for file-based routing, universal rendering, and improved maintainability. The frontend also includes `TypeScript` for type safety and thorough error-handling.

On the *backend*, the app uses the `Nitro` server to power the Nuxt framework. Authentication is handled using `Supabase` and Nuxt middleware, while the APIs are built using `Prisma` and a `Postgres` database from `Supabase`. This allows for type-safe access to data and easy tracking of student progress through the course.
